    <p>
      I am a Marine Veteran and my goal is to become a Software Developer. I
      have a passion about technology and also using tryhackme to learn
      cybersecurity. I am currently learing React JS. I know the fundementals of
      web development which include HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and the
      fundementals use of version control Git. What excites you the most about
      tech is the never stop learing and the challanges. I am also going to
      learn something new and improve myself as a developer. As for the
      challanges they are fun to encounter, I put on my thinking what and try to
      solve it.
